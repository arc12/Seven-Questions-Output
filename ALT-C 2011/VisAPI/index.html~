		["Will universities still be relevant in 2025 given the rise of education through other sources, e.g. online?\n\nWill Learning Technologists still be needed given the rise of social media and ubiquity of e-learning tools?\n\n","More tools that are user friendly to teachers on the ground allowing them to apply their teaching without barriers such as complicated authoring software.\n\nBetter mobile infrastructure for medical students working out in practice. Better acceptance amongst clinical teachers for the use of mobile technologies. \n\nBetter integration between NHS and university academic and teaching resources.\n\nBetter sharing in education community.","People need to think more about the ethical uses of tools such as facebook and twitter, issues such as digital identity, how twitter reflects your professional persona. Confusion between professional and personal.\n\nDisappointed if educational systems were migrated to large corporate systems such as Google and Blackboard. IPR issues. Danger of large corporations having a lot of control over educational material owned by institutions.

Better consultation with the faculties on decisions for new technologies to avoid duplicate systems.\n\nBetter management structure and fewer processes and committees to get decisions made more quickly.","Second Life - over-hyped.\nLearning communities are too eager to jump onto latest fad without digesting how things can be used for teaching.\n\nePortfolios","Serious review amongst academic staff and students about what's important to them, what they currently do in face to face setting that could be enhanced through the use of learning technology. More consultation with students on what would help them. A lot of decisions are made at management level without consulting the key stakeholders.","Take on more teaching staff to free up time for other staff."]		,
	
		["Is there more equality in access? What is the bottom line in what people have.","Being used as a means to educate rather than educating to use it. Focus on the learning not the tech. Using the Internet for the amazing resource that it is and creating good researchers.","Would not like to see a separation between learning technologists students and teachers.  Don't fall out with our stakeholders. ","Lecturers not led by teaching and learning moving from putting knowledge in the centre to co creating knowledge with students. closer gap between senior management, lecturers and support staff. \n\n","Not done it long enough to comment.","Better forum for academics to share good practice across institutions and internationally as well, more embedded in work than a conference.","Across education as a whole in the uk we are bound by tradition and cannot think beyond it.

Will it still exist?\n\nWhat are the key issues facing education and learning technology in 2025?","Seemless access to where the education is being provided.\nStudents don't have to know what tool they are using. More integration between.\n\nMore user friendly tools.\n\n\n\n","If people go off and do their own thing and use their own systems.  That would increase the support burden. \n\nIf people stopped using technology that would also be concern.","Better communication between central services and the faculties.\n\nMore money into central support rather than taking money away.\n","We need to look at what's out there more and stop reinventing the wheel.  Duplication of effort through different funding streams.\n\nSome of the tools that are developed need to be promoted more.  Hoe do you maintain these tools after they have been developed\n\nNeed for ongoing support for tools.","Should be a review of the best support models for the use of learning technology.  This will vary amongst institutions.\n\nWe need to make teaching in HE more of a profession. Could be something the HEA promotes.  Or bring in teaching fellows to do Year 1 & 2 teaching.","More money for education and remove the barriers of tuition fees."]		,
	
		["For me it's more the impossibility of predicting the future. It's seductive to think what might be. It's nearly impossible to predict Google, Facebook. These things come about unpredictably.\nAt the moment, there is more free-to-use software, but the business model is uncertain. I wonder whether all that is sustainable? ","The main thing I hope to see is driving down the cost of the hardware. So that everyone can afford the technology needed.\nI am not so happy with the division between formal and informal learning. I would like to see a blurring of learning. Learning is not just something you do at school.","There is a risk of people harvesting data, and using it for purposes for which it was not intended. Unethical use of the data that is everywhere, fx. supermarkets gathering data about customer behaviour, fx. buying sweets.","Different cultures between primary schools and higher education. Parts of the culture of primary school should move up the system. You would want teachers to care about their learners. Care in a more individual, personal sense, not economic care.\nThere are contractual limitations, too many differences between different 'classes' of employees. Issue of inequality between teaching and admin staff, for example.","When people offer something up as 'THE answer', the promise hardly ever became reality. You need a dose of criticalilty, and a sense of context and situatedness.","I think JISC should spread their money wider and thinner. Lightweight distribution of funding would decrease the risk of failure. It is very hard to pick winners to invest in. There are very many creative people out there who need incentives.","To give free hardware to everybody, so they can access everything."]		,
	
		["Was there a political back-lash against technology...was it accepted?\nIs the VLE\/LMS an important component?\nHave the majority of educations overcome their lack of engagement?\nWhat is the dominant form of technology being used?","Much more open-framework and interoperability established within \/ between systems - less silo mentality\n\nFull participation by educators and students in the learning process - multi-directional","Commercial silos of large multi-national groups\/vendors dominating the agenda, creating competing closed silos, eg Pearson\/Blackboard.","They need to become much better informed on detail around practical usage and competency in the implementation of the technology.\nThere needs to be culture of enabling off continuous innovations with more willingness for balanced risk.","Interactive media as a device for more interactive learning has proved to be much expensive and time consuming than was expected. \n\nPersonalisation of learning has proved more expensive and difficult using technology than traditional methods.\n\nInstitutional regulation has proved to be a constraint to rapid take-up of technology.","Major focus on teacher training in the use of technology.\n\nThink they should invest in awareness programmer but less biased open source solutions, as this can breed false economics.","Massive investment in the use of technology including free entitlement to the device if choice, plus investment in the UK supply chain to build a new industry which is world beating for the 21 Century."]		,

What has the technology enabled?\nWhat is the most common mode of interaction? What next beyond mouse and current gestural interfaces?\n","Further democratisation of education, more universal\/affordable access to resources and educational opportunities.\nBuilding and sharing.\nPeople have more of a stake in software development, e.g. able to design apps themselves","Technology favouring the elite (money, prior education, developed world...)","Embedding digital literacies is vital for educational professionals. Too many see this as an optional part of an HEI. This is both a cultural and a business development change.","One of the curses has hovered around the use of \"pilot\", the idea that a \"pilot\" will go away.\nUnwillingness to engage in dialogue about transformative change.","Evidence-based approach to change and making more from the strength of community based research.\nInstitutional managers made to fear being left behind => the action is to challenge management with evidence.","Connect learning technologies and education from nursery to HE through a funded model where government listens to the experts and expert-practitioners.\nSchool, FE and HE sectors move out of silos."]
